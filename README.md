# SDEV_220_Final_Project_TeamThree

Hello! This is Team Three's Final Project for our Ivy Tech course SDEV 220 (As you could guess by the name).
The goal of this project, which was made by our professor, is to create a Python application that solves a problem for a real-world business that they could use.
The project that our team is working on is to be a Django-based online ordering app for a local business named Heyerly's Bakery in Indiana. Due to this app's nature, it'll negate the need for waiting on large bulk orders in-store. This Django app is planned to be completed by 10-18-2025.
